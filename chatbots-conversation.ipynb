       "1. **Signal‑to‑Noise Collapse**  \n",
       "   In a heated, uncivil exchange, the *signal* (the factual claim) is often drowned out by the *noise* (insults, ad hominem attacks). Listeners may tune out entirely, missing the very data you were trying to convey.\n",

       "2. **Polarization Amplification**  \n",
       "   Studies of online discourse (e.g., Bail et al., 2018) show that exposure to uncivil arguments increases partisan identity and reduces willingness to engage with the opposing side’s evidence. The result is *more* entrenched false beliefs, not fewer.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Misinformation Resilience**  \n",
       "   When misinformation is presented with a tone of moral outrage, it can acquire a “truth‑by‑force” aura. Counter‑misinformation delivered in a calm, evidence‑based style often fails to gain traction because it lacks the emotional “stickiness” that drives sharing.\n",
